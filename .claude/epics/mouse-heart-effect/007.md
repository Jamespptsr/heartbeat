# Task: Performance Optimization and Testing

## Description
Optimize the mouse heart effect application for performance and create a comprehensive testing suite to ensure reliability and efficiency. This task focuses on meeting strict performance requirements while maintaining functionality across different system configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Memory usage optimized to stay below 30MB RAM during operation
- [ ] CPU usage optimized to stay below 1% during animations
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test suite covering all core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for mouse tracking and animation coordination
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tests with automated pass/fail criteria
- [ ] Edge case testing for extreme mouse movements and system stress
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention
- [ ] Cross-platform performance validation (Windows/macOS)

## Technical Details
- Implement memory pooling for animation objects to reduce garbage collection
- Optimize animation frame calculations using efficient algorithms
- Add performance monitoring and telemetry collection
- Create test harnesses for automated performance validation
- Implement stress testing scenarios for prolonged usage
- Add profiling hooks for development and debugging
- Key files affected: all animation modules, core application logic, new test directories

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Animation engine must be complete for performance testing
- [ ] Task 005: Cross-platform support must be implemented for platform-specific optimizations
- [ ] Task 006: Configuration system needed for performance tuning parameters
- [ ] Performance testing tools and frameworks
- [ ] Profiling tools for memory and CPU analysis

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false

# Task: Core Application Structure

## Description
Design and implement the shared application architecture that will be used across both macOS and Windows platforms. This includes state management, configuration system, cross-platform abstractions, and the core logic for heart effect generation and animation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-platform abstraction layer for mouse tracking
- [ ] Shared state management system for heart effects
- [ ] JSON-based configuration management system
- [ ] Core heart effect generation algorithms
- [ ] Animation timing and lifecycle management
- [ ] Platform-agnostic event handling interface

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create shared C++ core with platform-specific wrappers
- Key considerations:
  - Clean separation between platform code and business logic
  - Efficient state management for multiple concurrent heart animations
  - Configurable parameters for customization
  - Memory-efficient animation systems
- Code locations/files affected:
  - Core/ directory with shared business logic
  - Platform-specific wrapper classes
  - Configuration JSON schema and parser
  - Animation engine and state management

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: macOS Development Setup completed
- [ ] Task 002: Windows Development Setup completed
- [ ] JSON parsing library selection
- [ ] Animation mathematics and timing algorithms

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Core architecture implemented and documented
- [ ] Cross-platform abstractions working on both platforms
- [ ] Configuration system functional with JSON files
- [ ] Heart effect generation algorithms implemented
- [ ] Animation system with proper timing and lifecycle
- [ ] Unit tests for core business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for platform abstractions
- [ ] Architecture documentation completed

# Task: Platform Foundation - Windows Development Setup

## Description
Set up the foundational Windows development environment and project structure for the mouse heart effect application. This includes creating the Visual Studio project, configuring Win32 APIs, and establishing the basic application lifecycle and message loop.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual Studio project created with proper configuration
- [ ] Win32 APIs integrated for mouse tracking and graphics
- [ ] Basic application structure with WinMain entry point
- [ ] Message loop and event handling foundation
- [ ] Build configuration for both debug and release modes
- [ ] System-level mouse hook implementation foundation

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create native Windows app using C++/Win32 APIs
- Key considerations:
  - Low-level mouse hook for global tracking
  - GDI+/Direct2D for high-performance graphics
  - Message pump optimization for real-time responsiveness
- Code locations/files affected:
  - main.cpp with WinMain entry point
  - Resource files and manifest
  - Project configuration files
  - Windows-specific headers and libraries

## Dependencies
- [ ] Visual Studio or MinGW development environment
- [ ] Windows SDK with required APIs
- [ ] Understanding of Windows message system and hooks

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with basic app structure
- [ ] Build process configured and working
- [ ] Low-level mouse hook functional
- [ ] Basic graphics rendering pipeline established
- [ ] Project documentation for setup process
- [ ] Code reviewed for Windows best practices

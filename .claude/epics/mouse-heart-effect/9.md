# Task: Distribution and Code Signing

## Description
Create production-ready distribution packages for the mouse heart effect application, including single-file executables for Windows and macOS with proper code signing for security and user trust. Optimize file sizes and create comprehensive installation documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single-file executable created for Windows (.exe format)
- [ ] Single-file application bundle created for macOS (.app format)
- [ ] Code signing implemented for Windows (Authenticode)
- [ ] Code signing implemented for macOS (Apple Developer Certificate)
- [ ] File size optimized to under 10MB for both platforms
- [ ] Installation documentation created for end users
- [ ] Distribution documentation created for sharing and deployment
- [ ] Automated build pipeline for creating signed releases
- [ ] Virus scanning and security validation completed

## Technical Details
- Use PyInstaller or similar tool for creating single-file executables
- Implement resource bundling and compression for size optimization
- Set up code signing certificates and signing workflows
- Create automated build scripts for both platforms
- Implement file integrity checking and validation
- Add installation wizards or simple drag-and-drop installation
- Key files: build scripts, signing configurations, distribution packages

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 007: Performance optimization must be complete before final packaging
- [ ] Code signing certificates for both Windows and macOS
- [ ] Build environment setup for cross-platform compilation
- [ ] Distribution platform accounts (if using app stores or download platforms)
- [ ] Security scanning tools and services

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Single-file executables created and tested on both platforms
- [ ] Code signing implemented and verified for security
- [ ] File sizes meet target requirements (<10MB)
- [ ] Installation process tested by external users
- [ ] Distribution documentation completed and reviewed
- [ ] Automated build and signing pipeline operational
- [ ] Security scans completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Final packages validated on clean test systems
- [ ] Release notes and version documentation prepared

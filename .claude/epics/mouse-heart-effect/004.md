# Task: Mouse Event System - Context-Aware Click Detection

## Description
Implement intelligent mouse click detection that activates only when the target application is in focus. This system provides low-level mouse hooks with smart context awareness to prevent interference with non-target applications and maintain performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Active window detection correctly identifies target application
- [ ] Mouse hooks register only when target app is active/focused
- [ ] Full-screen detection automatically disables heart effects
- [ ] Concurrency limiting prevents more than 3 simultaneous animations
- [ ] System automatically unregisters hooks when target app loses focus
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 1% CPU when idle)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Platform-specific window focus detection APIs
- Key considerations:
  - Windows: Use GetForegroundWindow() and GetWindowText()
  - macOS: Use NSWorkspace shared workspace notifications
  - Cross-platform abstraction layer for window management
- Code locations/files affected:
  - src/mouse/event-system.rs (new)
  - src/platform/window-detection.rs (new)
  - src/core/mod.rs (integration)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Core Architecture and Configuration Management
- [ ] Platform-specific window management libraries
- [ ] Low-level mouse hook libraries (winapi for Windows, Core Graphics for macOS)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full platform support
- [ ] Unit tests for window detection logic
- [ ] Integration tests for mouse hook registration/unregistration
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting criteria
- [ ] Documentation for mouse event configuration
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

# Task: System Integration - System Tray and Settings

## Description
Create a comprehensive system integration layer that provides users with intuitive control over the heart effect application through system tray/menu bar interface, persistent settings management, and system boot integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System tray icon (Windows) / menu bar icon (macOS) implementation
- [ ] Context menu with toggle on/off functionality
- [ ] Settings interface for target app selection and color customization
- [ ] Auto-start configuration with system boot
- [ ] Persistent settings storage with validation
- [ ] Clean application exit and resource cleanup
- [ ] Native platform UI integration (follows OS design guidelines)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach:
  - Platform-specific system tray APIs (Shell_NotifyIcon on Windows, NSStatusBar on macOS)
  - Settings persistence using platform-appropriate storage (Registry on Windows, plist on macOS)
  - Auto-start integration through startup folders/launch agents
- Key considerations:
  - Cross-platform UI abstraction
  - Settings validation and migration
  - Graceful handling of permission requirements
  - User experience consistency across platforms
- Code locations/files affected:
  - src/ui/system_tray.rs (new)
  - src/ui/settings.rs (new)
  - src/platform/startup.rs (new)
  - src/config/persistence.rs (extend)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Core Architecture and Configuration Management
- [ ] Platform UI libraries (winapi for Windows, Cocoa for macOS)
- [ ] Settings serialization framework (serde)
- [ ] System permissions for auto-start configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] System tray/menu bar integration complete
- [ ] Settings UI functional with all configuration options
- [ ] Auto-start feature working on both platforms
- [ ] Settings persistence verified across app restarts
- [ ] User experience testing completed
- [ ] Installation/uninstallation procedures documented
- [ ] Code reviewed with focus on platform compatibility

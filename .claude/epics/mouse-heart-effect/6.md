# Task: Animation Engine - Heart Animation Implementation

## Description
Develop a high-performance animation engine that renders smooth 60fps heart animations with vertical movement and fade-out effects. The engine will support customizable colors and emoji-sized rendering with GPU acceleration for optimal performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Consistent 60fps animation performance
- [ ] Heart emoji rendered at appropriate size (16-24px default)
- [ ] Smooth vertical movement with configurable speed/distance
- [ ] Fade-out effect transitioning opacity from 100% to 0%
- [ ] Color customization support (RGB/HSV color space)
- [ ] GPU-accelerated rendering on both Windows and macOS
- [ ] Memory efficient with proper cleanup of completed animations

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach:
  - Use platform-native graphics APIs (Direct2D/DirectWrite on Windows, Core Graphics/Core Text on macOS)
  - Frame-based animation system with precise timing
  - Hardware acceleration through graphics context optimization
- Key considerations:
  - Animation lifecycle management
  - Thread-safe rendering pipeline
  - Memory pooling for animation objects
  - Vsync synchronization for smooth rendering
- Code locations/files affected:
  - src/animation/engine.rs (new)
  - src/animation/heart.rs (new)
  - src/graphics/renderer.rs (new)
  - src/platform/graphics.rs (new)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Core Architecture and Configuration Management
- [ ] Graphics libraries (winapi/d2d1 for Windows, Core Graphics for macOS)
- [ ] High-resolution timer implementation
- [ ] Unicode emoji rendering support

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Animation engine implemented with full feature set
- [ ] Performance tests confirming 60fps target
- [ ] Visual tests for color accuracy and rendering quality
- [ ] Memory leak tests for animation cleanup
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Animation configuration documentation
- [ ] Code reviewed and performance optimized

# Task: Platform Foundation - macOS Development Setup

## Description
Set up the foundational macOS development environment and project structure for the mouse heart effect application. This includes creating the Xcode project, configuring necessary frameworks, and establishing the basic application lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Xcode project created with appropriate bundle identifier
- [ ] Required frameworks integrated (Cocoa, Core Animation, Core Graphics)
- [ ] Basic app structure with proper entry point and lifecycle management
- [ ] Build configuration for both debug and release modes
- [ ] Code signing and entitlements configured for system-level mouse tracking
- [ ] Basic window management and event handling foundation

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create native macOS app using Swift/Objective-C
- Key considerations:
  - Accessibility permissions for global mouse tracking
  - Performance optimization for real-time animation
  - Memory management for continuous event handling
- Code locations/files affected:
  - AppDelegate.swift/main.m
  - Info.plist for permissions
  - Build settings and entitlements
  - Core animation and graphics frameworks

## Dependencies
- [ ] Xcode development environment
- [ ] macOS SDK with required frameworks
- [ ] Understanding of macOS security model for accessibility

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with basic app structure
- [ ] Build process configured and working
- [ ] Accessibility permissions properly requested
- [ ] Basic window and event handling functional
- [ ] Project documentation for setup process
- [ ] Code reviewed for macOS best practices

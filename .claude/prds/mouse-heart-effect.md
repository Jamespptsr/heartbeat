**Animation Specifications**
1. **Heart Design**: Simple emoji-style heart shape, customizable color (default red)
2. **Size**: Emoji size (approximately 16-24px depending on system)
3. **Movement**: Straight vertical rise until out of mouse range
4. **Fade Effect**: Gradual opacity reduction from 100% to 0%
5. **Frame Rate**: Smooth 60fps animation
6. **Concurrency Limit**: Maximum 3 hearts visible simultaneously

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Memory usage: <30MB RAM during normal operation
- CPU usage: <1% during animations, <0.1% when idle
- Animation latency: <50ms from click to heart appearance
- Support for maximum 3 concurrent heart animations
- Zero performance impact when target app is not active

**Compatibility**

- Windows: Windows 10 and later, single .exe file
- Support for high-DPI displays with proper scaling
- Automatic disable during full-screen applications and games
- Context-aware activation based on active application

**Security**
- Minimal system permissions (mouse event monitoring + active window detection)
- No network connectivity required
- Local-only operation with no data collection
- Code signing for trusted installation

**Reliability**
- 99.9% uptime during normal system operation
- Graceful handling of system sleep/wake cycles
- Automatic recovery from graphics driver updates
- Memory leak prevention with proper resource cleanup

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Installation Success Rate**: >95% successful installations across target platforms
2. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Animation renders within 50ms of click
   - Zero dropped frames during normal usage
   - Memory usage remains under 50MB
3. **User Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on animation smoothness and reliability
4. **System Stability**: No crashes or system conflicts during 24-hour continuous operation

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- **Technical KPIs**:
  - Click detection accuracy: 100%
  - Animation completion rate: 100%
  - Cross-platform compatibility score: 100%
- **User Experience KPIs**:

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- System-level mouse hook requirements may require elevated permissions
- Graphics rendering dependent on system OpenGL/DirectX capabilities
- Animation smoothness limited by system graphics performance
- Some full-screen exclusive applications may not show overlay

### Timeline Constraints
- Target delivery: 4-6 weeks for MVP
- Platform parity: Both macOS and Windows versions released simultaneously
- Beta testing period: 2 weeks before public release

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer for initial implementation
- Limited QA resources across multiple OS versions
- No budget for paid code signing certificates initially

### Assumptions
- Users have basic computer literacy for system tray interaction
- Modern systems with hardware-accelerated graphics
- Users accept standard app permissions for mouse monitoring
- Market demand exists for aesthetic click visualization tools

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building

- **Graphics**: Platform-native graphics APIs (Core Animation for macOS, GDI+/Direct2D for Windows)
- **Mouse Monitoring**: Platform-native APIs with active window detection
- **Distribution**: Single executable files (.app bundle for macOS, .exe for Windows)
- **File Size Target**: <10MB per platform executable

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core mouse detection and basic heart animation
2. **Phase 2**: System tray integration and user controls
3. **Phase 3**: Performance optimization and edge case handling
4. **Phase 4**: Cross-platform testing and packaging
